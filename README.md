# ServerSide-Communication
This is a java version of a popular game known as "Psych"

This Program Contains a .jar file, which containst he client side code already, and with my partner, we had to create the
server side in order for the program to communicate with the client.

There is a User Database file that is a .txt file where user information is stored for when we use our login system.
There is also a .txt file called "wordle" which contains the questions that the Client will receive from the server.

As of right now, there is a 2 person set limit for the number of users that can play because it was easier to work this way. If we were to include threading, it would allow for more users.
